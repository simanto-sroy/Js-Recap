***Bref discussuion OOP(Object Oriented Programming)

 *Object Oriented Programmign have Four Main Concept
    1. Abstractions 
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism

#Abstractions
    In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is:

    The process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details[2] or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance;[3] it is similar in nature to the process of generalization;
    the creation of abstract concept-objects by mirroring common features or attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study[3] â€“ the result of the process of abstraction

#Encapsulation
    In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components

#Inheritance
    In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes

#Polymorphism
    In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages
